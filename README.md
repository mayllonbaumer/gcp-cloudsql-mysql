# 🌟 Terraform GCS State Management

This project sets up a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to manage Terraform state files. Using a remote backend for state management helps ensure that your Terraform state is stored securely and can be accessed by multiple users. 🚀

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- 🌐 A Google Cloud account
- 🛠️ Google Cloud SDK installed and configured
- 📦 Terraform installed on your local machine
- ⚙️ **APIs to Enable**:
  - Secret Manager API
  - Cloud SQL Admin API

## Setup

### 1. Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project and configure the backend:

```bash
terraform init
```

### 5. Deploy Resources

After initialization, you can plan and apply your Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Security Considerations

- 🔑 Ensure that the service account or user running Terraform has appropriate permissions to access the GCS bucket.
- 📜 Enable **versioning** on the bucket to maintain history and enable recovery of previous states.

## Conclusion

This setup allows you to manage Terraform state files securely in a shared environment. By using a GCS bucket as the backend, you can collaborate with your team effectively while ensuring that your infrastructure state is consistent. 🌍
